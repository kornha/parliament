Observing people's shapes can reveal how they are suffering as a result of the scarcity of food entering Gaza. Tents are erected over the rubble of ruined buildings, leaving people vulnerable, without privacy, and suffering from horrible conditions,the sound of air drones and combats is ongoing, all accompanied by a sense of isolation among Gazans, separation from the outside world due to Internet and energy blackouts, anarchy due to the lack of anybody to impose security, and a loss of optimism that all of this nightmare would end soon.",
